# NBA1-24-001.pretty
KiCad footprint/symbol library and 3D model for the Pentaconn NBA1-24-001 (PCB mount 4.4mm) connector.  
Pads have soldermask on the topside to make it difficult to solder the connector on the incorrect side of the PCB.  

Based on the datasheet images on [this page](https://www.pentaconn.com/shopdetail/000000000002/plug_jack/page1/order/) and [this post](https://www.head-fi.org/threads/dx220-a-new-view-to-your-music-latest-fw-1-19-local-link-for-user-guide-1st-page.898388/page-179#post-14950324).

## Variants
- Regular - Footprint as recommended in the datasheet.
- Tight fit - Narrower PCB pads than spec for possibly closer contact between the PCB and the component legs.
